What is a brand?
•

A brand is not just a logo. A
brand should encapsulate who
we are and what we offer as an
institute.

•

It is our collective perception,
thoughts, and feelings that
define how we carry ourselves
and how we want to be
recognized.

•

It is a complete message
comprising of stories, goals, and
values. It is the foundation of an
organization, the core of every
significant step, the guide for
each part of the organization.

The Logo

NAME

DOST-STII
Font:
Gotham Black
Montserrat Black
or Arial Black

The three-color scheme represents
the unknown (black), truth and
enlightenment (white), and progress
(blue).

0.3175 cm

DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

0.3175 cm

0.3175 cm

The image at the center symbolizes
a human (red circle) sending signal
or information (6 arches/ripple
effect).

THE ICON

0.3175 cm

The space at the center of the
joined circles forms a four-pointed
star symbolic of scientific creativity.

The four circles represent the
four guiding principles in our S&T
development: Excellence, Relevance,
Cooperation and Cost-effectiveness.

0.3175 cm

The circles symbolize unit particles,
the building blocks of nature which
are the subject and substance
of science and technology. The
circle design gives an illusion of
movement signifying progress
through science and technology.

0.3175 cm

THE LOGO

The DOST-STII logo uses the DOST
official logo as its base icon that
consists essentially of four circles
joined together to form a square.

With the balance of its high
ascenders and short descenders,
flat apex, unbalanced crossbar,
rectangular punctuations, and
reflective shapes, the Gotham
typeface perfectly fits the DOSTSTII brand— honest tone that’s
assertive but never imposing,
friendly but never folksy, confident
but never aloof.

Some reminders when using the
ripple effect symbol.
• The ripple symbol should be
placed away from the text
• Should the ripple symbol blend
with any of the text, logo, photo
on the design, enclose the text,
logo, or photo in a rounded cap/
stadium shape layer or any solid
shape (or ensure that the color
of the text does not blend with
the color of the ripple symbol).
• The ripple symbol may be used
on top of a photo, but make sure
that it’s only applied as an accent
and will in no way cover the
subject on the photo.
• The ripple symbol may be used
as a border design but should
still be recognizable (laid out in

CERTIFICATE)
Because of the heavy text content
of a certificate, the template has
been made simple and carries only
the DOST-STII brand.
The “changeable” parts or layers of
the certificate are the logos and the

the lower right of the certificate.
The training or webinar icon should
